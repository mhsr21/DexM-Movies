### Fork and Clone the Repository

To contribute, you'll need to fork the repository and clone it to your machine:
1. **Fork** the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of this page.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone (https://github.com/mhsr21/DexM-Movies.git)
   \`\`\`
3. Set up the upstream remote to the original repository so you can fetch updates:
   \`\`\`bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mhsr21/DexM-Movies.git
   \`\`\`

## Making Changes

### Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

\`\`\`

### Make Your Changes

Implement your changes or improvements. Be sure to:
- Follow the coding style and conventions already in place.
- Include comments in your code where necessary.

### Commit Your Changes

Make commits that are small and logically separated:
\`\`\`bash
git add .
git commit -m "A brief description of the changes"
\`\`\`

### Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to keep your branch up-to-date:
\`\`\`bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
\`\`\`

### Push Changes to GitHub

Once you're ready to get feedback or merge, push your branch:
\`\`\`bash
git push origin main
\`\`\`

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Go to the repository on GitHub, and you'll see a prompt to open a pull request. Click the "Compare & pull request" button and:
1. Ensure the base repository is correct.
2. Provide a concise and informative title.
