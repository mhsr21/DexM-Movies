# DexM Movies
Our project _**DexM Movies**_ is an academic project for CPSC-415-02-Spring 2024 Special Topics: Large Scale and Open-Source Project Development at Trinity College, CT

## Application nature and purpose

This application is suggesting users a library of movies and tv-shows and allowing to receive basic information about it (_i.e_ name, release date, age recommendation, genre, budget, rating, IMDb ID, language and original poster). Moreover, a user has an option to search a movie having the name. Additionally, user might choose to search a list of movies or tv-shows within a certain range of years, as well as within a certain genre. One might choose to apply both filters. We also invite our users to use a random movie recommendation if they run out of ideas. If one have watched the movie already, they can rate them. The rated movies will be saved for this user.
